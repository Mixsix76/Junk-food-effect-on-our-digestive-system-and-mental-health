    <h1>How Junk Food Affects Our Digestive System and Mental Health</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Junk Food?</h2>
        <p>Junk food refers to food that is high in calories, fats, sugar, and salt, but low in essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Examples include chips, soda, candy, and fast food. While these foods are convenient and tasty, their consumption can have significant health implications.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Impact on the Digestive System</h2>
        <p>Junk food can wreak havoc on the digestive system in multiple ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Slow Digestion:</b> Foods high in unhealthy fats and low in fiber take longer to digest, leading to constipation and bloating.</li>
            <li><b>Acid Reflux:</b> Greasy and spicy junk foods can relax the lower esophageal sphincter, causing acid reflux and heartburn.</li>
            <li><b>Obesity:</b> Regular consumption of calorie-dense junk food increases the risk of obesity, which puts additional pressure on the digestive organs.</li>
            <li><b>Gut Microbiome Imbalance:</b> Junk food can disrupt the balance of healthy gut bacteria, which are crucial for digestion and overall health.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over time, these effects can lead to chronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and even liver damage due to excess fat accumulation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Impact on Mental Health</h2>
        <p>The link between diet and mental health is increasingly recognized. Junk food consumption impacts mental health in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Increased Anxiety and Depression:</b> Diets high in sugar and unhealthy fats can lead to inflammation in the brain, contributing to anxiety and depression.</li>
            <li><b>Mood Swings:</b> The rapid rise and fall in blood sugar levels caused by sugary junk foods can lead to sudden changes in mood and energy levels.</li>
            <li><b>Reduced Cognitive Function:</b> Poor nutrition affects memory, learning ability, and focus.</li>
            <li><b>Sleep Problems:</b> Caffeine and sugar in junk food can interfere with sleep, further worsening mental health.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over-reliance on junk food deprives the brain of essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and vitamins, which are critical for mental well-being.</p>
